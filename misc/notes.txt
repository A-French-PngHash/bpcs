# How it works

 * Host (cover/carrier) image
 * Secret data


0 Initial parameters

C0 : Complexity threshold



I. Preparing host image 

Divide host image data in 8 layers. (or 24 if image is not grayscale (rgb -> 8+8+8)).
Divide each bit layer into blocks of 8x8 bits (called bit planes).


II. Preparing secret data

Divide the secret data into 8x8 bits. Those are called the secret blocks. Go over each secret block and calculate its complexity : the number of borders between black and white pixels in each 8x8 plane divided by the total number of borders.
If a block complexity is lower than C0, conjugate the block (see Screens/conjugation.png). Store in a mapping table which blocks have been conjugated.


III. Embedding 

Then store
